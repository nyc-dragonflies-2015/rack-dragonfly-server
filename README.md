# Rack Dragonfly Server

Today the students of the nyc-dragonflies-2015 created three classes:

* HTTP Server
* HTTP Request
* HTTP Response

We did an iteration where we hard coded a string that looked like an HTTP
request.  We then integrated that onto Rack as a middleware.  Subsequently
`@sgharms` did some refactoring work.
